## Pinecone (Vector Database)

âš ï¸ **MANDATORY: If you need to help with Pinecone, vector databases, embeddings, semantic search, RAG, or recommendations, you MUST read `.agents/PINECONE.md` first** to determine:

- What questions to ask the user
- How to select the programming language
- Which guide files to consult for implementation details

Do not proceed with Pinecone-related tasks without consulting the appropriate guide files. Use `.agents/PINECONE.md` as your entry point and follow its "Choosing the Right Guide" section to navigate to the appropriate resources.
